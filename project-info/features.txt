List of phrases 
    Each phrase needs to have a phrase and a set of tags => see ./src/samplePhrases.js
    Phrases should be gender neutral in both speaker and subject, to allow for more re-use
    How to gather phrases   
        1. manual entry 
        2. crowdsource friends for thier favorite quotes
        3. gather LOTR quotes from the Lord of the Rings API
        4. Search online for popular fantasy quotes
        5. Ask reddit for input
        6. Pull requests on the github repo
    Concerns
        1. copywright/plagerism => a solution could be to add a bibliography to the app in an info page

    Optional means of gathering quotes
        1. Look at the most common D&D class/race combos e.g. human fighter or elf Wizard
        2. Create a personality for each common class/race combo
        3. Write a set of quotes for each class/race combo
        4. Add additional tags for other classes/races if they filter
